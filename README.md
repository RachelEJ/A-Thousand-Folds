# A-Thousand-Folds

Jacob Brasher and Rachel Jordan - A Thousand Folds

The Website as a Whole

Our thought process began with the decision to create a website designed to bring origami, the Japanese art of folding paper, to the Western world. The Home and Instructional Pages were wireframed before the coding process started, and thus began our weeks of hard work. The website was designed to be simple and straightforward so that anyone, whether young or old, can make origami. The color scheme was inspired by the Japanese flag, whose colors are white and red, but the colors were dialed down in intensity to make them easier to the eye. The logo was made by taking a picture of the crane model and tracing over it before positioning it at the top of the page next to the title.

Home Page

The home page features a Javascript slideshow of five various origami models. It uses code that creates a carousel of images that rotate at intervals of four seconds. Under lies a brief description of our website and the ambiguous history of the art of folding paper. The footer, which repeats on every page, is a simple code that keeps “2018 A Thousand Folds” at the bottom of the page. The Header, Navigation Bar, and Footer stay consistent on every page.

Folds Page

On the Folds Page there are pictures and descriptions showing ten types of folds, both singular and compound, that appear multiple times in various models ranging from both traditional to modern. The first four folds, the Mountain, Valley, Inside Reverse, and Outside Reverse, are arranged into two columns of two. The remaining six are arranged into three columns with their respected steps falling in place.

Base Page

Under the Basics tab, alongside the Folds Page, is the Base Page. This page pictures three of the many bases used frequently throughout origami. The three bases, the bird, the preliminary (also known as the square base), and the waterbomb, are arranged into an upside down triangle formation. When clicked on, these pictures take the user to the instructional page for that particular base.

Instructional Pages

Of the nineteen Instructional Pages, three teach the process of making the bases, and the remaining sixteen teach the actual models. Each page is arranged into having three columns with both Steps and Alternate Views when the folding instructions are not clear. These steps are shown with a picture and written descriptions.

Difficulty Levels

There are three difficulty levels, Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced, which include five models each with the exception of Intermediate, which has six. In actuality, many of the models in the Intermediate section can be passed for Beginner level; however, due to the website being meant for people who have never tried origami, the Intermediate section does provide a moderate challenge.

Questions Page

The Questions Page features a user form in which users can type in their email and feedback and submit it. This info is emailed directly to us, and we will try to reply as quickly as possible.

The Working Process

The working process for A Thousand Folds was long and strenuous. The majority of the time was spent debugging the code due to conflicting margins and spacing. Alongside this was the actual task of physically taking each and every picture featured in the website. Not a single picture was taken from any other source. Due to the short time we were able to work on the website, however, the website includes no true mobile version when scaling.

Final Thoughts

Overall, creating A Thousand Folds has provided a considerable challenge but has also helped us gain insight into working with deadlines and difficult obstacles. The effort put into many weeks of work has resulted in a simple website that is functional in teaching the foundations of the art of folding paper. Though flawed, the completion of A Thousand Folds is most certainly an achievement.
